## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

*	You need to have **MySQL** installed on your machine to run the application in **`dev`** profile. Using the `MySQL Workbench` or on any other MySQL client/console, create a database/schema named `reddit_clone`. 

~~~sql
-- create schema
CREATE SCHEMA reddit_clone;

-- use schema
USE reddit_clone;

-- Create user 
create user 'reddit_clone'@'localhost' identified by 'reddit_clone';

-- Grant privileges to user
grant all privileges on *.* to 'reddit_clone'@'localhost' with grant option;
~~~

After creating the database/schema, you need to add your **MySQL** `username` and `password` in the `application-dev.properties` file on `src/main/resource`. The lines that must be modified are as follows:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/reddit_clone?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
spring.datasource.username=reddit_clone
spring.datasource.password=reddit_clone
```

*	A Java Keystore File is required to generate JSON Web Token.

```shell
keytool -genkey -alias redditclone -keyalg RSA -keystore redditclone.jks -keysize 2048
```

### Installing

### Running the application with IDE

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `io.github.anantharajuc.rc.RedditCloneApplication` class from your IDE.

* 	Download the zip or clone the Git repository.
* 	Unzip the zip file (if you downloaded one)
* 	Open Command Prompt and Change directory (cd) to folder containing pom.xml
* 	Open Eclipse
	* File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the zip
	* Select the project
* 	Choose the Spring Boot Application file (search for @SpringBootApplication)
* 	Right Click on the file and Run as Java Application

### Running the application with Maven

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Spring-Boot-Framework/Reddit-Clone.git
$ cd Reddit-Clone
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Running the application with Executable JAR

The code can also be built into a jar and then executed/run. Once the jar is built, run the jar by double clicking on it or by using the command 

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Spring-Boot-Framework/Reddit-Clone.git
$ cd Reddit-Clone
$ mvn package -DskipTests
$ java -jar target/Reddit-Clone-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
```

To shutdown the jar, follow the below mentioned steps on a Windows machine.

*	In command prompt execute the **jcmd** command to print a list of all running Java processes
*	**Taskkill /PID PROCESS_ID_OF_RUNNING_APP /F** execute this command by replacing the **PROCESS_ID_OF_RUNNING_APP** with the actual process id of the running jar found out from executing the previous command

## Explore the APIs

* 	Postman Collection for offline testing is available in the **documents** folder.
